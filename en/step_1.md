## Introduction

In this project, you're going to make a website for a fake product: an amazingly high-tech cloaking device! The company would like some information about the product, and a gallery of photographs of it in use.

You will:
  + Make a template to let you build your pages faster
  + Create a navigation menu to link your site's pages together
  + Use CSS selectors to target HTML elements inside other HTML elements
