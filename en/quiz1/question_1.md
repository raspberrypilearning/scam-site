Which of these is the correct code for linking from `index.html` to `product.html` in the site you have just built?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `<a>product.html</a>`

  This will display a broken link, where the text of the link is "product.html". The URL for the target of a link needs to be in the `href` atribute of the tag, with the text of the link appearing between the opening and closing tags, like this:

  ```html
  <a href="https://raspberrypi.org"> the Raspberry Pi website </a>
  ```

- ( ) `<a href="https://oursite.com/product.html"> our product gallery </a>`

  --- feedback ---
  This is an absolute link, and will work if, and only if, the website exists at `oursite.com`. If it doesn't, or if the site moves to any other domain (e.g. `newsite.com`), then this link will break. There is a way to avoid this.

- (x) `<a href="product.html"> our product gallery </a>`

  --- feedback ---
  You're right! The relative link `product.html` will point from `index.html` to the product gallery as long as those two pages remain in the same directory, no matter where on the internet the website is located.
